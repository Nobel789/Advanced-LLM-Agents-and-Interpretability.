        "This is a demo notebook for [TransformerLens](https://github.com/TransformerLensOrg/TransformerLens), **a library I ([Neel Nanda](https://neelnanda.io)) wrote for doing [mechanistic interpretability](https://distill.pub/2020/circuits/zoom-in/) of GPT-2 Style language models.** The goal of mechanistic interpretability is to take a trained model and reverse engineer the algorithms the model learned during training from its weights. It is a fact about the world today that we have computer programs that can essentially speak English at a human level (GPT-3, PaLM, etc), yet we have no idea how they work nor how to write one ourselves. This offends me greatly, and I would like to solve this! Mechanistic interpretability is a very young and small field, and there are a *lot* of open problems - if you would like to help, please try working on one! **If you want to skill up, check out [my guide to getting started](https://neelnanda.io/getting-started), and if you want to jump into an open problem check out my sequence [200 Concrete Open Problems in Mechanistic Interpretability](https://neelnanda.io/concrete-open-problems).**\n",
        "\n",
        "I wrote this library because after I left the Anthropic interpretability team and started doing independent research, I got extremely frustrated by the state of open source tooling. There's a lot of excellent infrastructure like HuggingFace and DeepSpeed to *use* or *train* models, but very little to dig into their internals and reverse engineer how they work. **This library tries to solve that**, and to make it easy to get into the field even if you don't work at an industry org with real infrastructure! The core features were heavily inspired by [Anthropic's excellent Garcon tool](https://transformer-circuits.pub/2021/garcon/index.html). Credit to Nelson Elhage and Chris Olah for building Garcon and showing me the value of good infrastructure for accelerating exploratory research!\n",
        "\n",
        "The core design principle I've followed is to enable exploratory analysis - one of the most fun parts of mechanistic interpretability compared to normal ML is the extremely short feedback loops! The point of this library is to keep the gap between having an experiment idea and seeing the results as small as possible, to make it easy for **research to feel like play** and to enter a flow state. This notebook demonstrates how the library works and how to use it, but if you want to see how well it works for exploratory research, check out [my notebook analysing Indirect Objection Identification](https://neelnanda.io/exploratory-analysis-demo) or [my recording of myself doing research](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yo4QvDn-vsU)!"

It's convenient to have access to all activations, but this can be prohibitively expensive for memory use with larger models, batch sizes, or sequence lengths. In addition, we don't need to do the full forward pass through the model to collect layer 0 attention patterns. The following cell will collect only the layer 0 attention patterns and stop the forward pass at layer 1, requiring far less memory and compute."

        "\n",
        "In a classification neural net (e.g., image classifier), the last layer produces logits (raw scores), and softmax turns them into probabilities across classes.\n",
        "\n",
        "    That’s where we make the final decision (e.g., cat vs dog).\n",
        "\n",
        "    We train it with cross-entropy loss, which expects probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ So softmax at the output makes sense for class predictions.\n",
        "🔁 But in a Transformer, We Use Softmax in the Attention Layer — Why?\n",
        "Key insight:\n",
        "\n",
        "    We don’t use softmax to make a final prediction,\n",
        "    We use it to decide how much attention one token pays to others.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let me explain visually:\n",
        "🔗 Attention Mechanism Recap\n",
        "\n",
        "Each token wants to ask:\n",
        "\n",
        "    \"Whom should I listen to from the other tokens?\"\n",
        "\n",
        "It computes attention scores between itself and every other token (dot products of query and key vectors).\n",
        "These scores could be any real number, even negative.\n",
        "\n",
        "We apply softmax to these scores to turn them into attention weights:\n",
        "Example:\n",
        "Token Pair\tRaw Score\tSoftmax Weight\n",
        "\"The\" attends to \"cat\"\t2.0\t0.73\n",
        "\"The\" attends to \"sat\"\t1.0\t0.27\n",
        "\n",
        "Now the model will:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Take 73% of the info from \"cat\"\n",
        "\n",
        "    Take 27% of the info from \"sat\"\n",
        "\n",
        "This is how attention works.\n",
        "\n",
        "    🧠 Softmax makes attention selective and interpretable.\n",
        "\n",
        "✅ Why Softmax in Layer 0 (and all attention layers)?\n",
        "\n",
        "Even in Layer 0, the model must decide where to focus in the input sentence.\n",
        "\n",
        "Without softmax:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Attention scores could be unbounded (bad for training)\n",
        "\n",
        "    No normalization = no probabilistic interpretation\n",
        "\n",
        "    Could lead to unstable or arbitrary token mixing\n",
        "\n",
        "With softmax:\n",
        "\n",
        "    Token attends more strongly to relevant others\n",
        "\n",
        "    Prevents exploding weights or \"fuzzy\" mixing\n",
        "\n",
        "    Enables multiple heads to learn different focus patterns\n",

This means that you can intervene within a layer on each activation, and don't need to care about the precise layer structure of the transformer. And it's immediately clear exactly how the hook's effect is applied.

        "    X-axis (\"index\"): Represents the position of each token in the sequence. There are 100 positions (0 to 99), which matches the repeated sequence length from your code (original sequence length of 50, repeated to make 100).\n",

        "    Positions 0–49: The loss is consistently high (around 11–15). In this first half, the model is predicting random tokens it has likely never seen together, so its predictions are essentially guesses, resulting in high loss values.\n",

No one *really* knows why it works, but it seems to improve model numerical stability. Unlike BatchNorm, LayerNorm actually changes the functional form of the model, which makes it a massive pain for interpretability!\n",

The OV Circuit for a head (the factorised matrix $W_OV = W_V W_O$) is a linear map that determines what information is moved from the source position to the destination position. Because this is low rank, it can be thought of as *reading in* some low rank subspace of the source residual stream and *writing to* some low rank subspace of the destination residual stream (with maybe some processing happening in the middle).\n",
        "\n",
        "A common operation for this will just be to *copy*, ie to have the same reading and writing subspace, and to do minimal processing in the middle. Empirically, this tends to coincide with the OV Circuit having (approximately) positive real eigenvalues. I mostly assert this as an empirical fact, but intuitively, operations that involve mapping eigenvectors to different directions (eg rotations) tend to have complex eigenvalues. And operations that preserve eigenvector direction but negate it tend to have negative real eigenvalues. And \"what happens to the eigenvectors\" is a decent proxy for what happens to an arbitrary vector.\n",

This is enough of a big deal that it leads to a visible *bump* in the loss curve, where the model's rate of improvement briefly increases."
